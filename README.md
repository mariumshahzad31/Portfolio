I made this portfolio website as part of an assignment for the Modern Web Development course at SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training). I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build it, and it showcases some of my personal projects and the skills I’ve been learning in frontend development. The site has a simple and clean design with sections like About, Projects, and Contact, and it’s fully responsive so it looks good on all devices. I originally kept the GitHub repo private, but I’ve now made it public to share my work more openly.
